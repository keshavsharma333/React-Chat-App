In this code we will be building a fully functional instant messaging application using React and Firebase. 

=======
# React-Chat-App
You can sign up with an email and password and chat with multiple users. All the chat users and chat history will be saved, you just have to replace Firebase API keys with your own.

STEPS TO RUN THE APP IN YOUR LOCAL MACHINE:

1.Clone the repository(git clone https://github.com/keshavsharma333/React-Chat-App.git)

2.Go to app directory by command "cd React-Chat-App"

3.Run command "npm i" to install node modules

4.Run the app using "npm start"

You can then click on register and register with your gmail and password. You can chat with as many users as you want, chat data is stored in firebase. You can replace my Firebase credentials with yours to store all data in your database.
